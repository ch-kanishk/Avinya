# Frontend Developer Test - Kanishk

## Project Overview
This project is a simple, responsive landing page designed to attract new leads. It includes a navigation menu, a hero section with an email input form, and a section showcasing trusted companies. The design is clean, with animations for a modern look and a mobile-friendly menu for improved accessibility.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Provides the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Handles styling, animations, and responsiveness.
- **Bootstrap 5**: Used for layout and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity, such as the mobile menu toggle function.

## File Structure
- `index.html` - The main HTML structure of the page.
- `style.css` - Handles all the styling, including layout, colors, animations, and responsive design.
- `script.js` - Contains the JavaScript function for the mobile menu toggle.

## Approach
1. **Navigation Bar**
   - Implemented a fixed navigation bar with a logo and menu links.
   - Included a mobile menu that slides up on smaller screens.
   
2. **Hero Section**
   - Used large, animated text to create an eye-catching call to action.
   - Added an email input form to encourage user interaction.
   - Used CSS animations to progressively reveal elements.

3. **Animations & Responsiveness**
   - Used CSS animations for fade-in and slide effects.
   - Ensured the layout adjusts for different screen sizes using media queries.

## Challenges & Solutions
### 1. Responsive Mobile Menu
- **Issue**: The menu needed to slide up and down on smaller screens.
- **Solution**: Used JavaScript to toggle a class (`show-menu`) and control visibility using CSS transitions.

### 2. Text Animation
- **Issue**: The large heading text animation needed to appear in sequence.
- **Solution**: Applied staggered CSS animations (`fadeInSlideUp`) to individual words.

### 3. Background & Image Alignment
- **Issue**: The `hero` section background images had to be properly aligned on different screen sizes.
- **Solution**: Used `background-size: cover` and positioned elements carefully to maintain consistency.

## Future Improvements
- Improve the mobile menu for a smoother transition.
- Add more interactive elements, such as hover effects.
- Optimize performance by reducing animation load.

## How to Run the Project
Simply open the `index.html` file in a browser. Ensure `style.css` and `script.js` are linked properly for full functionality.
